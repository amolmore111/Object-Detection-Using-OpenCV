# Object-Detection-Using-OpenCV
Object Detection Using OpenCV Library and Using streamlit Python framework

The Object Detection Web App is a mini project that aims to leverage the power of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection in a web-based environment. Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video.

The YOLO algorithm stands out among other object detection algorithms for its impressive speed and accuracy. It operates by dividing the input image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the grid cells. This unique approach allows YOLO to achieve real-time object detection capabilities, making it highly suitable for various applications, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality.

The Object Detection Web App provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to upload images or videos for object detection. Additionally, users can utilize their webcam for real-time object detection. The web application is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library that simplifies the development of interactive web applications.

By combining the YOLO algorithm's capabilities with the ease of use and interactivity of Streamlit, the Object Detection Web App offers a seamless and accessible experience for users to detect and visualize objects of interest. The app provides visual feedback by highlighting the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels, enhancing the overall user experience.
In the following sections of this mini project report, we will delve into the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusion. We will explore the implementation details, the features of Streamlit utilized in the web application, and the implications of the project's success in bridging the gap between object detection algorithms and web-based user interfaces.

OpenCV: OpenCV is used for image and video processing, including reading and decoding images/videos, performing object detection with YOLO, and drawing bounding boxes.

YOLO (You Only Look Once): YOLO is an object detection algorithm that enables real-time detection by predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the input image or video frames.

Streamlit: Streamlit simplifies web application development by providing an intuitive interface for creating interactive web interfaces, allowing users to upload images/videos, select options, and display the object detection results seamlessly.

NumPy: NumPy is used for efficient numerical operations, such as handling image data, calculating detection confidence scores, and manipulating arrays of bounding box coordinates in the Object Detection Web App.


The Object Detection Web App successfully achieved the objectives of implementing object detection using the YOLO algorithm and providing a user-friendly web interface. The web application, built with Streamlit, allowed users to upload images or videos for object detection and also provided real-time object detection using the webcam. The detected objects were visually highlighted with bounding boxes and labels using Streamlit's interactive visualization capabilities.
